## User Experience (UX)

#### User Goals

1. I want a timer that allows me to edit the duration of the work and break sessions. It's important that I'm able to customize the lengths as sometimes I prefer my work sessions to be longer or shorter than the standard 25 minutes of a typical pomodoro.
1. I want to be able to know how many work sessions I have completed while using the timer.
1. I want a sound to play to notify me of the timer status so i don't have to be looking at the screen while I'm working to check if it's time for a break.

#### Developers Goals

1. I want the user to be able to use the timer with no previous knowledge of what a pomodoro is.
1. I want the user the to be able to choose a light or dark mode for the application. This is something I personally like to see on all software that I use.
1. I want a pomodoro timer that is simple to use and minimalist in its design on all devices. I would like all the information that the user requires to be in front of them at all times and doesn't require scrolling or clicking onto another page.
1. I want to implement functionality to pause and reset the timer If user sessions are interrupted and they need to restart. However, I don't want them to lose the correct completed sessions  count if this were to occur.
