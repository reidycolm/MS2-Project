For my second project as a Code Institute student, I decided to make something that I would get everyday use out of. Since being introduced to the pomodoro technique, it has become my go to way to study. It's a very simple but effective method and I thought it would be cool to make my own. I'm really happy with how it turned out and no longer need any pomodoro apps on my phone. As I continue to learn more Javascript going forward, I feel like this is something I will continue to upgrade and add interesting features to. 

## User Experience (UX)

- #### User Goals

1. I want a timer that allows me to edit the duration of the work and break sessions. It's important that I'm able to customize the lengths as sometimes I prefer my work sessions to be longer or shorter than the standard 25 minutes of a typical pomodoro.

1. I want to be able to know how many work sessions I have completed while using the timer.

1. I want a sound to play to notify me of the timer status so i don't have to be looking at the screen while I'm working to check if it's time for a break.

- #### Developers Goals

1. I want the user to be able to use the timer with no previous knowledge of what a pomodoro is.

1. I want the user the to be able to choose a light or dark mode for the application. This is something I personally like to see on all software that I use.

1. I want a pomodoro timer that is simple to use and minimalist in its design on all devices. I would like all the information that the user requires to be in front of them at all times and doesn't require scrolling or clicking onto another page.

1. I want to implement functionality to pause and reset the timer If user sessions are interrupted and they need to restart. However, I don't want them to lose the correct completed sessions  count if this were to occur.

- #### Design

    * **Colour Scheme:** I used the Port Gore colour as the main background and Crimson for the text. When I think of a pomodoro, this crimson red type colour always comes to mind. The font awesmoe icons as well as the actual timer itself is the Snow colour (except for the moon and sun which are gamboge as I felt they looked better reflecting their natural self). For the light mode theme, I used this same Snow colour as the background, kept the text Crimson red and used a standard Black colour for the icons and buttons so they were easily visable.

    * **Font:** The font used for this project is called Shippori Mincho B1. I played around with a few different styles but kept coming back to this one. I think it's very authentic style and fits in with the minimalist type of design I was going for.

    * **Icons:** I wanted every icon that I used to be self explanatory and be able to convey its intended purpose to the user. I feel like I accomplished this as you can easily tell what every button does without the need of actual text alongside it.

    * **Audio:** Two different sounds were used to help the user distinguish between work and break sessions. When a break is earned, a pleasant and relaxing bell sound can be heard. This is contrasted by a sudden "GONG" sound that plays when it is time to get back to work.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://reidycolm.github.io/MS2-Project/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://reidycolm.github.io/MS2-Project/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://reidycolm.github.io/MS2-Project/)
2. Under the repository name, click the "Code" button and a dropdown menu will appear.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
